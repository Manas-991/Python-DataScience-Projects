# Python-DataScience-Projects
These are the projects that I worked on while doing my Data Science and Machine Learning course, these files contain several datasets and projects with EDA and prediction models for each of them
This also includes course material that I referenced for said course, the projects were in the form of exercises but gave enough learning experience.
